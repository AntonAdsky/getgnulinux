# Get GNU/Linux!

This is the web application for the [getgnulinux.org](http://getgnulinux.org) site. Get GNU/Linux! is a simple, clear website about GNU/Linux. What is Linux? Why not Windows? Tips to make the switch. With this website we hope to reach people who never heard about free software and barely remotely heard the word "Linux".

The website is written in PHP and JavaScript, and uses GNU gettext for internationalization.


## Setup

This section explains the basic steps needed to setup the website on your web server. Before you continue, there a few things that you need:

* Shell or FTP access to your Apache web server with PHP and gettext installed
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/)
* [GNU gettext](http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) utilities
* [GNU Make](http://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* A text editor
* And your web browser of choice

First step is to download the source code from GitHub:

    $ git clone https://github.com/figure002/getgnulinux.git

This clones the repository into a new directory called `getgnulinux`. This is the root directory for the website. Make sure Apache is configured to serve from this directory. This directory also contains a hidden file `.htaccess` which is required for the website to function properly. Either make sure that .htaccess files are processed for this website, or copy the rules from this .htaccess file to the Apache configuration file for this site. Also make sure that Apache module `mod_rewrite` is enabled:

    $ a2enmod rewrite

The site should now be running on http://localhost/. It will tell you that you need to create a file `settings.php` in the root directory. Run the following command from the root directory to create it:

    $ make config

Now open the newly created `settings.php` in a text editor and change the settings where needed.

Other languages will not work until both the required locale definition files and the translations are built on the server. Usually, the locale definition files are already built on the server, but if you need to build them you can run:

    $ make localesgen

This command must be executed on the server as root.

Compile the translation files with:

    $ make mo

You need to recompile the translation files every time a translation fileÂ (\*.po) was updated. You can use the `LOCALES` variable to specify which languages to compile (default is to compile all), for example:

    $ make mo LOCALES='ia es_ES fr_FR'
