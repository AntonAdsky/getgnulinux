<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">If you've
been
pointed at this page, then the chances are you're a relatively new
Linux user
who's having some problems making the switch from Windows to Linux.
This causes
many problems for many people, hence this article was written. Many
individual
issues arise from this single problem, so the page is broken down into
multiple
problem areas.</span></p>
<h3><b><span style="">Problem
#1: Linux
isn't exactly the same as Windows.</span></b><span style=""></span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">You'd be
amazed how
many people make this complaint. They come to Linux, expecting to find
essentially <a href="http://www.reactos.com/">a free, open-source version of Windows.</a> Quite often, this
is what
they've been told to expect by over-zealous Linux users. However, it's
a
paradoxical hope.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The
specific reasons
why people try Linux vary wildly, but the overall reason boils down to
one
thing: They hope Linux will be better than Windows. Common yardsticks
for
measuring success are cost, choice, performance, and security. There
are many
others. But every Windows user who tries Linux, does so because they
hope it
will be better than what they've got.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Therein
lies the
problem.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">It is
logically
impossible for any thing to be better than any other thing whilst
remaining
completely identical to it. A perfect copy may be equal, but it can
never
surpass. So when you gave Linux a try in hopes that it would be better,
you
were inescapably hoping that it would be different. Too many people
ignore this
fact, and hold up every difference between the two OSes as a Linux
failure.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">As a
simple example,
consider driver upgrades: one typically upgrades a hardware driver on
Windows
by going to the manufacturer's website and downloading the new driver;
whereas
in Linux you upgrade the kernel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">This
means that a
single Linux download &amp; upgrade will give you the newest
drivers available
for your machine, whereas in Windows you would have to surf to multiple
sites
and download all the upgrades individually. It's a very different
process, but
it's certainly not a bad one. But many people complain because it's not
what
they're used to.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Or, as an example you're more likely
to relate to, consider Firefox: One of the biggest open-source success
stories. A web browser that took the world by storm. Did it achieve
this success by being a perfect imitation of IE, the then-most-popular
browser?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">No. It was successful because it was <span style="font-style: italic;">better</span> than IE, and
it was <span style="font-style: italic;">better</span>
because it was <span style="font-style: italic;">different</span>.
It had tabbed browsing, live bookmarks, built-in searchbar, PNG
support, adblock extensions, and other wonderful things. The <span style="font-style: italic;">"Find"</span>
functionality appeared in a toolbar at the bottom and looked for
matches as you typed, turning red when you had no match. IE had no
tabs, no RSS functionality, searchbars only via third-party extensions,
and a find dialogue that required a click on <span style="font-style: italic;">"OK"</span> to start
looking and a click on <span style="font-style: italic;">"OK"</span>
to clear the <span style="font-style: italic;">"Not
found" </span>error message. A clear and inarguable
demonstration of an open-source application achieving success by being
better, and being better by being different. Had FF been an&nbsp;IE
clone, it would have vanished into obscurity. And had Linux been a
Windows clone, the same would have happened.<span style=""></span></p>
<p><span style="">So the
solution to
problem #1: Remember that where Linux is familiar and the same as what
you're
used to, it <span style="font-weight: bold;">isn't</span>
new &amp; improved. Welcome the places where things are
different, because only here does it have a chance to shine.</span></p>
<p><span style=""></span></p>
<h3><span style=""></span><span style=""><b>Problem
#2: Linux is <span style="font-style: italic;">too</span>
different from Windows</b></span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The next
issue
arises when people do expect Linux to be different, but find that some
differences are just too radical for their liking. Probably the biggest
example
of this is the sheer amount of choice available to Linux users. Whereas
an
out-of-the-box-Windows user has the Classic or XP desktop with Wordpad,
Internet Explorer, and Outlook Express installed, an
out-of-the-box-Linux user
has hundreds of distros to choose from, then Gnome or KDE or Fluxbox or
whatever, with vi or emacs or kate, Konqueror or Opera or Firefox or
Mozilla,
and so on and so forth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">A Windows
user isn't
used to making so many choices just to get up &amp; running.
Exasperated <i>"Does
there have to be so much choice?"</i> posts are very common. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="">Does</span></i><span style=""> Linux really have to be so different from
Windows? After all, they're both operating systems. They both do the
same job:
Power your computer &amp; give you something to run applications
on. Surely
they should be more or less identical?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Look at
it this way:
Step outside and take a look at all the different vehicles driving
along the
road. These are all vehicles designed with more or less the same
purpose: To
get you from A to B via the roads. Note the variety in designs.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">But, you
may be
thinking, car differences are really quite minor: they all have a
steering
wheel, foot-pedal controls, a gear stick, a handbrake, windows
&amp; doors, a
petrol tank. . . If you can drive one car, you can drive any car!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Quite
true. But did
you not see that some people weren't driving cars, but were riding
motorbikes
instead. . ?</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Switching
from one
version of Windows to another is like switching from one car to
another. Win95
to Win98, I honestly couldn't tell the difference. Win98 to WinXP, it
was a
bigger change but really nothing major.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">But
switching from
Windows to Linux is like switching from a car to a motorbike. They may
both be <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">OSes/road
vehicles</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">.</span>
They may both use the same <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">hardware/roads</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">.</span>
They may both <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">provide
an environment for you to run applications/transport you from A to B</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">.</span>
But
they use fundamentally different approaches to do so.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><span style="">Windows/cars</span></b><span style="">
are not safe from <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">viruses/theft</b>
unless you <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">install an
antivirus/lock the doors</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">. </span><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Linux/motorbikes</b>
don't have <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">viruses/doors</b>,
so are perfectly safe
without you having to <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">install
an antivirus/lock any doors</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Or look
at it the
other way round:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"><span style="">Linux/cars</span></b><span style="">
were designed from the ground up for
multiple <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">users/passengers</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">. </span><b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Windows/motorbikes</b>
were designed for
one <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">user/passenger</b>.
Every <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Windows
user/motorbike driver</b><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">
</span>is used
to being in full control of his <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">computer/vehicle</b>
at
all times. A <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Linux
user/car passenger</b> is used to only being in control of his <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">computer/vehicle</b>
when <b style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">logged in as
root/sitting in the driver's seat</b>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Two
different
approaches to fulfilling the same goal. They differ in fundamental
ways. They
have different strengths and weaknesses: A car is the clear winner at
transporting a family &amp; a lot of cargo from A to B: More seats
&amp; more
storage space. A motorbike is the clear winner at getting one person
from A to B:
Less affected by congestion and uses less fuel.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">There are
many
things that <b>don't</b> change when you switch between
cars and motorbikes:
You still have to put petrol in the tank, you still have to drive on
the same
roads, you still have to obey the traffic lights and Stop signs, you
still have
to indicate before turning, you still have to obey the same speed
limits.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">But there
are also many
things that <b>do</b> change: Car drivers don't have to
wear crash helmets,
motorbike drivers don't have to put on a seatbelt. Car drivers have to
turn the
steering wheel to get around a corner, motorbike drivers have to lean
over. Car
drivers accelerate by pushing a foot-pedal, motorbike drivers
accelerate by
twisting a hand control.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">A
motorbike driver
who tries to corner a car by leaning over is going to run into problems
very
quickly. And Windows users who try to use <b>their</b>
existing skills and
habits generally also find themselves having many issues. In fact,
Windows
"Power Users" frequently have <i>more</i> problems with
Linux than
people with little or no computer experience, for this very reason.
Typically,
the most vehement <i>"Linux is not ready for the desktop yet"</i>
arguments come from ingrained Windows users who reason that if <b>they</b>
couldn't make the switch, a less-experienced user has no chance. But
this is
the exact opposite of the truth.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">So, to
avoid problem
#2: Don't assume that being a knowledgeable Windows user means you're a
knowledgeable Linux user: When you first start with Linux, you are a
novice.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""></span></p>
<h3><b><span style="">Problem
#3:
Culture shock</span></b><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subproblem
#3a: There <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>
a culture</span><b><span style=""></span></b><span style=""></span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Windows
users are
more or less in a customer-supplier relationship: They pay for
software, for
warranties, for support, and so on. They expect software to have a
certain
level of usability. They are therefore used to having rights with their
software: They have paid for technical support and have every right to
demand
that they receive it. They are also used to dealing with entities
rather than
people: Their contracts are with a company, not with a person.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">Linux
users are in
more of a community. They don't have to buy the software, they don't
have to
pay for technical support. They download software for free &amp;
use Instant
Messaging and web-based forums to get help. They deal with people, not
corporations.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">A Windows
user will
not endear himself by bringing his habitual&nbsp;attitudes over to
Linux, to
put it mildly.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">The
biggest cause of
friction tends to be in the online interactions: A "3a" user new to
Linux asks
for help with a problem he's having. When he doesn't get that help at
what he
considers an acceptable rate, he starts complaining and demanding more
help.
Because that's what he's used to doing with paid-for tech support.
The
problem&nbsp;is
that this <i>isn't</i> paid-for support. This is a bunch
of volunteers who are
willing to help people with problems out of the goodness of their
hearts. The
new user has no right to demand anything from them, any more than
somebody
collecting for charity can demand larger donations from contributors.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">In much
the same way, a
Windows user is used to using commercial software. Companies don't
release
software until it's reliable, functional, and user-friendly enough. So
this is
what a Windows user tends to expect from software: It starts at version
1.0.&nbsp;Linux
software,
however, tends to get released almost as soon as it's written: It
starts at
version 0.1. This way, people who really need the functionality can get
it
ASAP; interested developers can get involved in helping improve the
code; and
the community as a whole stays aware of what's going on.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">If a "3a"
user runs
into trouble with Linux, he'll complain: The software hasn't met his
standards,
and he thinks he has a right to expect that standard. His mood won't be
improved when he gets sarcastic replies like <i>"I'd demand a
refund if I
were you"</i></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="">So, to
avoid problem
#3a: Simply remember that you haven't paid the developer who wrote the
software
or the people online who provide the tech support. They don't owe you
anything.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style=""></span><b><span style=""></span></b></p>
<h3><b><span style="">Subproblem
#3b:
New vs. Old</span></b><span style=""></span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Linux pretty
much started out life as a
hacker's hobby. It grew as it attracted more hobbyist hackers. It was
quite some time before anybody but a geek stood a chance of getting a
useable Linux installation working easily. Linux started out&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">"By geeks, for geeks."</span>
And even today, the majority of established Linux users are
self-confessed geeks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And that's a pretty good
thing: If you've got
a problem with hardware or software, having a large number of geeks
available to work on the solution is a definite plus.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But Linux has grown up
quite a bit since its
early days. There are distros that almost anybody can install, even
distros that live on CDs and detect all your hardware for you without <span style="font-style: italic;">any</span>
intervention. It's become attractive to non-hobbyist users who are just
interested in it because it's virus-free and cheap to upgrade. It's not
uncommon for
there to be friction
between the two camps. It's important to bear in mind, however, that
there's no real malice on either side: It's lack of understanding that
causes the problems.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Firstly, you get the
hard-core geeks who
still assume that everybody using Linux is a fellow geek. This means
they expect a high level of knowledge, and often leads to accusations
of arrogance,
elitism, and rudeness. And in truth, sometimes that's what it is. But
quite often, it's not:&nbsp;It's elitist to say&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">"Everybody ought to know this"</span>.
It's not elitist to say&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">"Everybody
knows this"</span> - quite the opposite.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Secondly,&nbsp;you get
the new users who're trying to make the switch after a lifetime of
using commercial OSes. These users are used to software that anybody
can sit down &amp; use, out-of-the-box.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The issues arise
because&nbsp;group 1 is made up of people who enjoy being able to
tear their OS apart and rebuild it the way they like it, while group 2
tends to be indifferent to the way the OS works, so long as it <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A parallel situation that
can emphasize the problems is Lego. Picture the following:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">New: <span style="font-style: italic;">I wanted a new toy car, and
everybody's raving about how great Lego cars can be. So I bought some
Lego, but when I got home, I just had a load of bricks and cogs and
stuff in the box. Where's my car??</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Old: <span style="font-style: italic;">You have to build the car out of
the bricks. That's the whole point of Lego.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">New: <span style="font-style: italic;">What?? I don't know how to build
a car. I'm not a mechanic. How am I supposed to know how to put it all
together??</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Old: <span style="font-style: italic;">There's a leaflet that came in
the box. It tells you exactly how to put the bricks together to get a
toy car. You don't need to know how, you just need to follow the
instructions.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">New: <span style="font-style: italic;">Okay, I found the instructions.
It's going to take me hours! Why can't they just sell it as a toy car,
instead of making you have to build it??</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Old: <span style="font-style: italic;">Because not everybody wants to
make a toy car with Lego. It can be made into anything we like. That's
the whole point.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">New: <span style="font-style: italic;">I still don't see why they can't
supply it as a car so people who want a car have got one, and other
people can take it apart if they want to. Anyway, I finally got it put
together, but some bits come off occasionally. What do I do about this?
Can I glue it?</span></p>
Old: <span style="font-style: italic;">It's Lego. It's
designed to come apart. That's the whole point.</span>
<p class="MsoNormal">New: <span style="font-style: italic;">But I don't <span style="font-weight: bold;">want</span> it to come
apart. I just want a toy car!</span></p>
Old: <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Then why on Earth did you buy a
box of Lego??</span></span>
<p class="MsoNormal">It's clear to just about anybody that
Lego is not really aimed at
people who just want a toy car. You don't get conversations like the
above in real life. The whole point of Lego
is that you have fun building it and you can make anything you like
with it. If
you've no interest in building anything, Lego's not for you. This is
quite obvious.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As far as the long-time Linux user is
concerned, the same holds true for Linux: It's an open-source,
fully-customizeable set of software. That's the whole point. If you
don't want to hack the components a bit, why bother to use it?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But there's been a lot of effort
lately to make Linux more suitable for the non-hackers, a situation
that's not a million miles away from selling pre-assembled Lego kits,
in order to make it appeal to a wider audience. Hence you get
conversations that aren't far away from the ones above:
Newcomers&nbsp;complain about the existence of what the established
users consider to be fundamental features, and resent having the read a
manual to get something working. &nbsp;But complaining that there
are too many distros; or that software has too
many configuration options; or that it doesn't work perfectly
out-of-the-box; is like complaining that Lego can be made into too many
models, and not liking the fact that it can be broken down into bricks
and built into&nbsp;many other things.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So, to avoid problem #3b: Just
remember that what Linux seems to be now is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span>
what Linux was in the past. The largest and most necessary part of the
Linux community, the hackers and the developers, like Linux <span style="font-weight: bold;">because</span> they can fit
it together the way they like; they don't like it in <span style="font-weight: bold;">spite</span> of having to
do all the assembly before they can use it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Problem #4:
Designed for the
designer</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the car industry, you'll very
rarely find that
the person who designed the engine also designed the car interior: It
calls for totally different skills. Nobody wants an engine that only <span style="font-style: italic;">looks</span> like it can
go fast, and nobody wants an interior that works superbly but is
cramped and ugly. And
in the same way, in the software industry, the user interface (UI) is
not usually created by the people who wrote the software.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the Linux world, however, this is
not so much
the case: Projects frequently start out as one man's toy. He does
everything himself, and therefore the interface has no need of any kind
of <span style="font-style: italic;">"user friendly"</span>
features:
The user knows everything there is to know about the software, he
doesn't need help. Vi is a good example of software deliberately
created for a user who already knows how it works: It's not unheard of
for new users to reboot their computers because they couldn't figure
out
how else to get out of vi.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">However, there is an important
difference between
a FOSS programmer and most commercial software writers: The software a
FOSS programmer creates is software that he intends to use. So whilst
the end result might not be as 'comfortable' for the novice user, they
can draw some comfort in knowing that the software is designed by
somebody who knows what the end-users needs are: He too is an end-user.
This is very different from commercial software writers, who are making
software for <span style="font-style: italic;">other
people</span> to use: They are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> knowledgeable
end-users.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So whilst vi has an interface that is
hideously
unfriendly to new users, it is still in use today because it is such a
superb interface once you know how it works. Firefox was created by
people who regularly browse the Web. The Gimp was built by people who
use it to manipulate graphics files. And so on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So Linux interfaces are frequently a
bit of a
minefield for the novice: Despite its popularity, vi should never be
considered by a new user who just wants to quickly make a few changes
to a file. And if you're using software early in its lifecycle,
a&nbsp;polished, user-friendly interface is something you're likely
to
find only in the <span style="font-style: italic;">"ToDo"</span>
list: Functionality comes first. Nobody designs
a killer interface and then tries to add functionality bit by bit. They
create functionality, and then improve the interface bit by bit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So to avoid #4 issues: Look for
software that's
specifically aimed at being easy for new users to use, or accept that
some software that has a steeper learning curve than you're used to. To
complain that vi isn't friendly enough for new users is to be laughed
at for missing the point.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<h3>Problem #5: The myth of "user-friendly"</h3>
<p>This is a big one. It's a very big term in the computing
world,
"user-friendly". It's even the name of a particularly good webcomic.
But it's a bad term.</p>
<p>The basic concept is good: That software be designed with the
needs
of the user in mind. But it's always addressed as a single concept,
which it isn't.&nbsp;</p>
If you spend your entire life processing text files, your ideal
software will be fast and powerful, enabling you to do the maximum
amount of work for the minimum amount of effort. Simple keyboard
shortcuts and mouseless operation will be of vital importance.<br>
<p>But if you very rarely edit text files, and you just want to
write
an occasional letter, the last thing you want is to struggle with
learning keyboard shortcuts. Well-organized menus and clear icons in
toolbars will be your ideal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clearly, software designed around the needs of the first user
will
not be suitable for the second, and vice versa. So how can any software
be called "user-friendly", if we all have different needs?</p>
<p>The simple answer: User-friendly is a misnomer, and one that
makes a complex situation seem simple.</p>
<p>What does "user-friendly" really mean? Well, in the context in
which it is used, "user friendly" software means <span style="font-style: italic;">"Software that can be used to a
reasonable level of competence by a user with no previous experience of
the&nbsp;software."</span> This has the unfortunate effect of
making lousy-but-familiar interfaces&nbsp;fall into the category of
"user-friendly".&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Subproblem #5a: Familiar is friendly</h3>
<p>So it is that in most "user-friendly" text editors &amp;
word
processors, you Cut and Paste by using Ctrl-X and Ctrl-V. Totally
unintuitive, but everybody's used to these combinations, so they count
as a "friendly" combination.</p>
<p>So when somebody comes to vi and finds that it's "d<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>" to cut, and "p"
to paste, it's not considered
friendly: It's
not what anybody is used to.</p>
<p>Is it superior? Well, actually, yes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Ctrl-X approach, how do you cut a word from the
document you're currently in? <span style="font-style: italic;">(No
using the mouse!)</span></p>
From the start of the word, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ctrl-Shift-Right</span>
to select the word.&nbsp;<br>
Then <span style="font-style: italic;">Ctrl-X</span>
to cut it.
<p>The vi approach? <span style="font-style: italic;">dw</span>
deletes the word.</p>
<p>How about cutting <span style="font-weight: bold;">five</span>
words with a Ctrl-X application?</p>
From the start of the words, <span style="font-style: italic;">Ctrl-Shift-Right</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Ctrl-Shift-</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Right</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Ctrl-Shift-</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Right</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Ctrl-Shift-</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Right</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Ctrl-Shift-</span><span style="font-style: italic;">Right</span><br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">Ctrl-X</span>
<p>And with vi?</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">d5w</span></p>
<p>The vi approach is far more versatile and actually
more&nbsp;intuitive: "X" and "V" are not obvious or memorable "Cut"
and "Paste" commands, whereas "dw" to <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">d</span>elete
a <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">w</span>ord,
and "p" to <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">p</span>ut
it back is perfectly straightforward. But "X" and "V" are what we all
know, so whilst vi is clearly superior, it's unfamiliar.
Ergo, it
is considered unfriendly. On no other basis, pure familiarity makes a
Windows-like interface seem friendly. And as we learned in problem #1,
Linux
is necessarily different to Windows. Inescapably, Linux always appears
less
"user-friendly" than Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid #5a problems, all you can really do is try and
remember
that <span style="font-style: italic;">"user-friendly"</span>
doesn't mean <span style="font-style: italic;">"What I'm
used to"</span>: Try doing things
your usual way, and if it doesn't work, try and work out what a total
novice would do.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Subproblem #5b: Inefficient is friendly</h3>
<p>This is a sad but inescapable fact. Paradoxically, the harder
you
make it to access an application's functionality, the friendlier it can
seem to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is because friendliness is added to an interface by using
simple, visible 'clues' - the more, the better. After all, if a
complete novice to computers is put in front of a WYSIWYG word
processor and asked to make a bit of text bold, which is more likely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>He'll guess that <span style="font-style: italic;">"Ctrl-B"</span>
is the usual standard&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>He'll look for clues, and try clicking on the <span style="font-style: italic;">"Edit"</span> menu.
Unsuccessful, he'll try the next likely one along the row of menus: <span style="font-style: italic;">"Format"</span>. The new
menu has a <span style="font-style: italic;">"Font"</span>
option, which seems promising. And Hey! There's our <span style="font-style: italic;">"Bold"</span> option.
Success!</li>
</ul>
<p>Next time you do any processing, try doing every job via the
menus:
No shortcut keys, and no toolbar icons. Menus all the way. You'll find
you slow to a crawl, as every task suddenly demands a multitude of
keystrokes/mouseclicks.</p>
Making software "user-friendly" in this fashion is like putting
training wheels on a bicycle: It lets you get up &amp; running
immediately, without any skill or experience needed. It's <span style="font-style: italic;">perfect</span> for a
beginner. But nobody out there thinks that <span style="font-style: italic;">all</span> bicycles should
be sold
with
training wheels: If you were given such a bicycle today, I'll wager the
first
thing you'd do is remove them for being unnecessary encumbrances:
Once you know how to ride a bike, training wheels are unnecessary.
<p>And in the same way, a great deal of Linux software is
designed
without "training wheels" - it's designed for users who already have
some basic skills in place. After all, nobody's a permanent novice:
Ignorance is short-lived, and knowledge is forever. So the software is
designed with the majority in mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This might seem an excuse: After
all, MS Word has all the friendly menus, <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> it has toolbar
buttons,
<span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> it has
shortcut keys. . . Best of all worlds, surely?
Friendly&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span>
efficient.</p>
<p>However, this has to be put into perspective: Firstly, the
practicalities: having menus and toolbars and shortcuts and all would
mean a lot of coding, and it's not like Linux developers all get paid
for their time.&nbsp;Secondly, it still doesn't really take into
account
serious&nbsp;power-users: Very few professional wordsmiths use MS
Word. Ever meet a coder who used MS Word? Compare that to how
many use emacs &amp; vi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is this? Firstly, because some "friendly"
behaviour rules out efficient behaviour: See the "Cut&amp;Copy"
example
above. And secondly, because most of Word's functionality is buried in
menus that you <span style="font-style: italic;">have</span>
to use:
Only the most common functionality has those handy little buttons in
toolbars at the top. The less-used functions that are still vital for
serious users just take too long to access.</p>
<p>Something to bear in mind, however, is that "training wheels"
are
often available as "optional extras" for Linux software: They might not
be obvious, but frequently they're available.</p>
<p>Take mplayer. You use it to play a video file by typing <span style="font-style: italic;">mplayer filename</span>
in a terminal. You fastforward &amp; rewind using the arrow keys
and
the PageUp &amp; PageDown keys. This is not overly "user-friendly".
However, if you instead type <span style="font-style: italic;">gmplayer
filename</span>, you'll get the graphical frontend, with all its
nice, friendly , familiar buttons.</p>
<p>Take ripping a CD to MP3 (or Ogg): Using the command-line, you
need
to use cdparanoia to rip the files to disc. Then you need
an&nbsp;encoder. . . It's a hassle, even if you know exactly how to
use the
packages <span style="font-style: italic;">(imho)</span>.
So download
&amp; install something like Grip. This is an easy-to-use graphical
frontend that uses cdparanoia and encoders behind-the-scenes to make it
really easy to rip CDs, and even has CDDB support to name the files
automatically for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same goes for ripping DVDs: The number of options to pass
to
transcode is a bit of a nightmare. But using dvd::rip to talk to
transcode for you makes the whole thing a simple, GUI-based process
which anybody can do.</p>
<p>So to avoid #5b issues: Remember that "training wheels" tend
to
be&nbsp;bolt-on extras in Linux, rather than being automatically
supplied with the main product. And sometimes, "training wheels" just
can't be part of the design.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Problem #6: Imitation vs. Convergence</h3>
<p>An argument people often make when they find that Linux isn't
the Windows clone they wanted is to insist that this is what Linux has
been (or <span style="font-style: italic;">should</span>
have been) attempting to be since it was created, and that people who
don't
recognise this and help to make Linux more Windows-like are in the
wrong. They draw on many arguments for this:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Linux has gone from
Command-Line- to Graphics-based interfaces, a clear attempt to copy
Windows</p>
<p>Nice theory, but false: The original X windowing system was
released in 1984, as the successor to the W windowing system ported to
Unix in 1983. Windows 1.0 was released in 1985. Windows didn't really
make it
big until version 3, released in 1990 - by which time, X windows had
for years been at the X11 stage we use today. Linux itself was only
started in 1991. So Linux didn't create a GUI to copy Windows: It
simply made use of a GUI that existed long before Windows.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Windows 3 gave way to
Windows 95 - making a huge level of
changes to the UI that Microsoft has never equalled since. It had many
new &amp; innovative features: Drag &amp; drop functionality;
taskbars,
and so on. All of which have since been copied by Linux, of course.</p>
<p>Actually. . . no. All the above existed prior to Microsoft
making use
of them. NeXTSTeP in particular was a hugely advanced (for the time)
GUI, and it predated Win95 significantly - version 1 released in 1989,
and the final version in 1995. </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">Okay, okay, so Microsoft
didn't think up the individual features that we think of as the Windows
Look-and-Feel. But it still created <strong>a</strong>
Look-and-Feel, and Linux has been trying to imitate that ever since.</p>
<p>To debunk this, one must discuss the concept of <em>convergent
evolution</em>.
This is where two completely different and independent systems evolve
over time to become very similar. It happens all the time in biology.
For example, sharks and dolphins. Both are (typically) fish-eating
marine organisms of about the same size. Both have dorsal fins,
pectoral fins, tail fins, and similar, streamlined shapes.</p>
<p>However,
sharks evolved from fish, while dolphins evolved from a land-based
quadrupedal mammal of some sort. The reason they have very similar
overall appearances is that they both evolved to be as efficient as
possible at living within a marine environment. At no stage did
pre-dolphins (the relative newcomers) look at sharks and think <em>"Wow,
look at those fins. They work really well. I'll try and evolve some
myself!"</em></p>
<p>Similarly,
it's perfectly true to look at early Linux desktops and see FVWM and
TWM and a lot of other simplistic GUIs. And then look at modern Linux
desktops, and see Gnome &amp; KDE with their taskbars and menus and
eye-candy. And yes, it's true to say that they're a lot more like
Windows than they used to be.</p>
<p>But then, so is Windows: Windows 3.0 had no taskbar that I
remember. And the Start menu? <span style="font-style: italic;">What</span>
Start menu?</p>
<p>Linux didn't have a desktop anything like modern Windows.
Microsoft didn't either. Now they both do. What does this tell us?</p>
<p>It
tells us that developers in both camps looked for ways of improving the
GUI, and because there are only a limited number of solutions to a
problem, they often used very similar methods. Similarity does not in
any way prove or imply imitation. Remembering that will help you avoid
straying into problem #6 territory.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Problem #7: That FOSS thing.</h3>
<p>Oh, this causes problems. Not intrinsically: The software
being free and open-source is a wonderful and immensely important part
of the whole thing. But understanding just how different FOSS is from
proprietary software can be too big an adjustment for some people to
make.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've already mentioned some instances of this: People thinking
they can demand technical support and the like. But it goes far beyond
that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft's Mission Statement is <span style="font-style: italic;">"A computer on every desktop"</span>
- with the unspoken rider that each computer should be running Windows.
Microsoft and Apple both sell operating systems, and both do their
utmost to make sure their products get used by the largest number of
people: They're businesses, out to make money.</p>
<p>And then there is FOSS. Which, even today, is almost entirely
non-commercial.</p>
<p>Before you reach for your email client to tell me about Red
Hat, Suse, Linspire and all:&nbsp;Yes, I know they "sell" Linux. I
know they'd all love Linux to be
adopted universally, especially their own flavour of it. But don't
confuse the suppliers with the manufacturers. The
Linux kernel was not created by a company, and is not maintained by
people out to make a profit with it. The GNU tools were not created by
a company, and are not maintained by people out to make a profit with
them. The X11 windowing system. . . well, the most popular
implementation is xorg right now, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">".org"</span> part should
tell you
all you need to know. Desktop software: Well, you might be able to make
a case for KDE being commercial, since it's Qt-based. But Gnome,
Fluxbox, Enlightenment, etc. are all non-profit. There <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span> people out to
sell Linux, but they are very much the minority.</p>
<p>Increasing the number of end-users of proprietary software
leads to a direct financial benefit to the company that makes it. This
is simply not the case for FOSS: There is no direct benefit to any FOSS
developer in increasing the userbase. Indirect benefits, yes: Personal
pride; an increased potential for finding bugs; more likelihood of
attracting new developers; possibly a chance of a good job offer; and
so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Linus Torvalds doesn't make money from increased Linux
usage. Richard Stallman doesn't get money from increased GNU usage. All
those servers running OpenBSD and OpenSSH don't put a penny into the
OpenBSD project's pockets. And so we come to the biggest problem of all
when it comes to new users and Linux:</p>
<p>They find out they're not wanted.</p>
<p>New users come to Linux after spending their lives using an OS
where the end-user's needs are paramount, and <span style="font-style: italic;">"user friendly"</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">"customer focus"</span>
are considered veritable Holy Grails. And they
suddenly find themselves using an OS that still relies on 'man' files,
the
command-line,&nbsp;hand-edited configuration files, and Google. And
when they complain, they don't get coddled or promised better things:
They get bluntly shown the door.</p>
<p>That's an exaggeration, of course.
But it <span style="font-style: italic;">is</span>
how a lot of potential Linux converts perceived things when
they tried and failed to make the switch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an odd way, FOSS is actually a very selfish development
method:
People only work on what they want to work on, when they want to work
on it. Most people don't see any need to make Linux more attractive to
inexperienced end-users: It already does what&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">they</span> want it to do,
why should they care if it doesn't work for other people?&nbsp;</p>
<p>FOSS has many parallels with the Internet itself: You don't
pay the
writer of <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">a
webpage/the
software</span> to download and <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">read/install</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);"> </span>it. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Ubiquitous
broadband/User-friendly interfaces</span> are of no great
interest to
somebody who already <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">has
broadband/knows how to use the software. Bloggers/developers</span>
don't need to have lots of <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">readers/users</span>
to justify <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">blogging/coding</span>.</span>
There <span style="font-style: italic;">are</span>
lots of people making lots of money off it, but it's not by
the old-fashioned <span style="font-style: italic;">"I
own this&nbsp;and you have to pay me if you want some of it"</span>
method that most businesses are so enamoured of; it's by providing
services like <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">tech-support/e-commerce</span><span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linux is not interested in market share. Linux does not have
customers. Linux does not have shareholders, or a responsibility to the
bottom line. Linux was not created to make money. Linux does not have
the goal of being the most popular and widespread OS on the planet.</p>
<p>All the Linux community wants is to create a really good,
fully-featured, free operating system. If that results in Linux
becoming a hugely popular OS, then that's great. If that results in
Linux having the most intuitive, user-friendly interface ever created,
then that's great. If that results in Linux becoming the basis of a
multi-billion dollar industry, then that's great.</p>
<p>It's <span style="font-weight: bold;">great</span>,
but it's not <span style="font-weight: bold;">the
point</span>. The point is to make Linux the best OS that the
community is capable of making. Not for other people: For
itself. The oh-so-common threats of&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">"Linux will never take over the
desktop unless it does such-and-such"</span> are simply
irrelevant: The Linux community isn't <span style="font-style: italic;">trying</span> to take over
the desktop. They really don't care if it gets good enough to make it
onto&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">your</span>
desktop, so long as it stays good enough to remain on&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">theirs.</span> The
highly-vocal MS-haters, pro-Linux zealots, and money-making FOSS
purveyors might be loud, but they're still minorities.</p>
<p>That's what the Linux community wants: an OS that can be
installed by whoever really wants it. So if you're
considering switching to Linux, first ask yourself what <span style="font-weight: bold;">you</span> really want.</p>
<p>If you want an OS that doesn't chauffeur you around, but hands
you the keys, puts you in the driver's seat, <span style="font-style: italic;">and expects you to know what to
do</span>: Get Linux. You'll have to devote some time to learning
how to use it, but once you've done so, you'll have an OS that you can
make sit up and dance. </p>
<p>If you really just want Windows without the malware and
security issues: Read up on good security practices; install a good
firewall, malware-detector,&nbsp;and anti-virus; replace IE with a
more secure browser; and keep yourself up-to-date with security
updates. There are people out there <span style="font-style: italic;">(myself included)</span>
who've used Windows since 3.1 days right through to XP without ever
being infected with a virus or malware: you can do it too. Don't get
Linux: It will fail miserably at being what you want it to be.</p>
<p>If you really want the security and performance of a
Unix-based OS but with a customer-focussed attitude and an
world-renowned interface: Buy an Apple Mac. OS X is great. But don't
get Linux: It will not do what you want it to do.</p>
<p>It's not just about <span style="font-style: italic;">"Why
should I want Linux?"</span>. It's also about <span style="font-style: italic;">"Why should Linux want me?"</span></p>
